I'm also a person like you, and I must admit that there are days that I suffer, and feel lonely for some reasons.
One thing I always do when times like this occur is distract myself.
I would watch my favorite series and shows in YouTube. My favorite one is SEVENTEEN's Going Seventeen. Such a breather. 
I would always make sure to treat myself, or simply buy my favorite food or drinks. 
You could never really go wrong with that combo, right?
Just, clear your mind. 
You are doing so well :)
